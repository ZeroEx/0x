    <h1>Zombies At My Conference!!</h1>
    <p>Have you ever wondered what would happen if the zombie apocalypse began whilst you where at a conference? Would you survive?
    Would you risk your life drinking free beer, or just run away?</p>
    <p>Zombies at my conference is a multiplayer zombie simulation written for Node Knockout 2013.</p>
    <p>
    You can select a conference to watch as the battle between zombies and humans plays out.
    You can add and move free beer around the map to attract humans and you can play Dubstep to attract zombies (you knew zombies love Dubstep didn't you).
    Who do you want to win? Now's your chance to finish off that annoying fella you met at <a href="/conference/nodeconfeu/2013/unknown?lat=52.25350&lng=-7.05934">NodeConfEU</a>, 
    or rescue all your friends from the <a href="/conference/gbnc/2013/unknown">Great British Node Conference</a>.</p>
    <p>
    Remember, all viewers are seeing the same thing, and <strong>you</strong> can change the outcome by influencing the simulation.
